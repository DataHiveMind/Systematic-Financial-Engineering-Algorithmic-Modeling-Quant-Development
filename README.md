## Problem Statement

Financial markets are complex, driven by stochastic dynamics, volatility, and risk exposure. Hedge funds require robust quantitative models that can:

- Accurately price derivatives using stochastic and Monte Carlo methods.

- Evaluate interest rate dynamics under Vasicek and CIR models.

- Perform portfolio risk analysis using advanced statistical techniques.

- Implement machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

- Conduct rigorous backtesting to ensure model reliability.

- Optimize database management and time-series analysis for financial datasets.

## Solutions

To address these challenges, this project implements:

- Option Pricing Models: Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree, and Monte Carlo methods.

- Risk Modeling Frameworks: Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall, and regulatory-compliant validation.

- Stochastic Interest Rate Analysis: Vasicek and CIR models using PDE-based numerical solutions.

- Portfolio Optimization & Return Analysis: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, drawdown metrics.

- Backtesting & Machine Learning: Python-driven predictive models with historical financial data.

- Time-Series & Database Management: KDB+/q-based structured queries for market trends.

- Financial Modeling in Excel: Monte Carlo simulations, risk assessment, and derivative pricing.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages multiple programming languages, each focusing on specialized financial applications:

- Python: Backtesting, machine learning, risk modeling.

- R: Statistical analysis, portfolio evaluation, exploratory data processing.

- MATLAB: Numerical methods, PDE-based stochastic modeling.

- KDB+/q: Time-series analytics, high-frequency market data structuring.
